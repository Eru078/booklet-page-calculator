# booklet-page-calculator

This repository is a fork of the original project by georgjaehnig to include the option for 4 pages per sheet.





You can print booklets with your regular printer without installing any extra plugins, and even if your software does not have booklet support.

This script calculates the page order for your printing dialog to print a booklet.
