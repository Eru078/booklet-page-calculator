# booklet-page-calculator

Print 8 pages on 1 sheet of paper, 4 pages per side. Then you can cut and fold it into a booklet.

This repository is a fork of the original project by georgjaehnig to include the option for 4 pages per sheet.





You can print booklets with your regular printer without installing any extra plugins, and even if your software does not have booklet support.

This script calculates the page order for your printing dialog to print a booklet.
